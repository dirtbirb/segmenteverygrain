# Example Image from the Swiss Alps

The image in this folder comes from the data collected by Mair et al. (2022) from gravel bars of rivers in the Swiss Alps, using drones and structure-from-motion software. See the paper below for more details. This image is used in the `segmenteverygrain` example notebook to illustrate how the segmentation can be run on large images.
